# Project Overview

CHG Unified Design System is a multi-brand design system built with React, React Aria Components, and Tailwind CSS 4. It supports 6 CHG brands from a single Figma source file:

- **Weatherby** (default)
- **CompHealth**
- **Modio**
- **Connect**
- **LocumSmart**
- **Wireframe**

## Tech Stack

- React 19
- React Aria Components (accessibility)
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Storybook 8
- Figma Code Connect
- Node.js 20+

## Key Principle

**This is a Figma-first design system.** Every component MUST have a Figma source. Use the Figma MCP to fetch component data before implementing.
